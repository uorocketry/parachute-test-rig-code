!!!!!!!!    VERY IMPORTANT    !!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!    READ THIS FIRST   !!!!!!!!

This program works only with the following models:
DI-1120, -2108, -4108, -4208, AND -4718B
Any other instrument model should be disconnected from the PC
to prevent the program from detecting a device with a DATAQ
Instruments VID and attempting to use it. 
Such attempts will fail.

You'll need to uncomment the appropriate 

slist
analog_ranges

tuples for the instrument model you will use with this program.
Prototypes are provided for each supported model, so it's a
simple matter of commenting the ones that don't apply, and 
uncommenting the one that does. In its as-delivered state
the program assumes that model DI-2108 is connected. 

Instruments used with this program MUST be placed in their
CDC communication mode. 
Follow this link for guidance:
https://www.dataq.com/blog/data-acquisition/usb-daq-products-support-libusb-cdc/

Any specific instrument's protocol document can be downloaded from the instrument's 
product page: Once there, click the DETAILS tab.

Uncomment the slist tuple depending upon the hardware model you're using. 
You can modify the example tuples to change the measurement configuration
as needed. Refer to the instrument's protocol for details. Note that 
only one slist tuple can be enabled at a time.

0x0000 = Analog channel 0, ±10 V range

"""
Uncomment an analog_ranges tuple depending upon the hardware model you're using. 
Note that only one can be enabled at a time. 
The first item in the tuple is the lowest gain code (e.g. ±100 V range = gain code 0)
for the DI-4208. Some instrument models do not support programmable gain, so 
their tuples contain only one value (e.g. model DI-2108.)
